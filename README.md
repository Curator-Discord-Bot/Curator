### Curator
Curator is a discord bot written by Ruukas and RJTimmerman.
It is currently early in development, and we still have many ideas that we want to implement. The bot is mainly developed for the Infinity Item Editor discord. However, we will work on having the bot run on several servers in the future.

#### TODO List

 - mc commands should accept both username, uuid, and discord mentio (if verified)
 - improve pie chart
 - work on item hub
 - make counts persistent after restarts
 - allow simultaneous counts
 - add timestamp to auths and remove expired auths
 - at auth, remove uuid from any other accounts that might have it
